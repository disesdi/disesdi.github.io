-------

***â†’ Understand threats*** *to AI systems, quantify risk, design mitigations, & engineer solutions at scale to the highest engineering standards, at the edge of the SOTA.*

***â†’ Go beyond the headlines*** *to understand context, think about AI security at a systems level, anticipate AI security threats, and stay ahead of the hype.*

***â†’ Use threat modeling to teach*** *AI teams how to de-silo expertise, think like hackers, and deploy like defenders.*

***â†’ Results:*** *AI security analysis for forward looking, systems thinking, research driven insights.*
